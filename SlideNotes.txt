Progress from previous semester:
- Last semester vs. this semester screenshots - created a functional, useable site
- Interviewed sample users
- Reworked the code to be useable with any stop, rather than hardcoded for the Green Street stop
- Included new features (service alerts, clock, weather, bus route labels)

Next semester:
- Integrate data from the solar controller into the site display (amount of energy generated/saved for the day, usage of USB chargers in shelter, etc.)
- Continue working with users and iterating on the current design - adding, removing, or revamping certain display elements
- Finish actualizing the system on the Raspberry Pi and screen infrastructure within the shelter itself
